*** Introduction ***

This repository contains the Mod Code Generator (MCG) program, which is code
generator tool that allows for C code generation from the Modelio environment.

The MCG program consists of two main components:
    - the Converter Component, which is responsible for conversion of a model
      created within the Modelio environment into configuration file,
    - the Code Generator Component, which is responsible for code generation
      from the configuration file.


*** Prerequisites ***

To take advantage of the full capabilities of the MCG program, please obtain:
    - Modelio v4.1.00
    - Python v3.9.6

The required Modelio and Python releases can be found at:

*** Build, Usage and Licensing ***

All further details related with the MCG program can be found in the Mod Code
Generator Manual document under this repository.
