# This parameter for production version of Mod Code Generator (MCG) Converter Component (CC)
# should be set to false, otherwise it allows to display additional information in console
# during run of Mod Code Generator (MCG) Converter Component (CC)
MCG_CC_TEST_RUN = True

# This parameter defines offset of signal name after "target" marker in merged node, i.e. number of
# characters after occurrence of "target" marker, where beginning of signal name occurs, an example:
# eng_gain1 target eng_gain2 target ADD a084fca5-1c0a-4dfd-881b-21c3f83284e7 target eng_gain_total
TARGET_OFFSET = 7

# This parameter defines offset of signal name after "*FIRST*" marker in merged node or line of .exml file,
# i.e. number of characters after occurrence of "*FIRST*" marker, where beginning of signal name occurs, an example:
# *FIRST* some_signal *FIRST*
FIRST_INPUT_SIGNAL_OFFSET = 8

# This parameter defines offset of action uid before end of action definition, i.e. number of characters
# before occurrence of action definition end, where beginning of action uid occurs, plus one additional
# character to accommodate space between action type and action uid, an example:
# ADD fd5be3ed-0d38-42d0-ab56-d1058657eee8
ACTION_UID_OFFSET = -37

# This parameter defines offset, which is used to cut off first input signal node from merged node, i.e. first input
# signal, its two markers "*FIRST*" and "target" marker, please note that length of first input signal name must be
# added to the offset in order to calculate final offset used to cut desired part from merged node, an example of
# merged node with first input signal node and without it:
# eng_temp1 target *FIRST* eng_temp2 *FIRST* target SUB 4de5134b-40f6-44ae-a649-1cacb525963b target eng_temp_diff
# eng_temp1 target SUB 4de5134b-40f6-44ae-a649-1cacb525963b target eng_temp_diff
CUT_FIRST_INPUT_SIGNAL_OFFSET = 23

# This parameter defines expected number of command line arguments passed to Mod Code Generator (MCG)
# Converter Component (CC), i.e. list of arguments:
#       - model path
NUMBER_OF_MCG_CC_CMD_LINE_ARGS = 1

# This list defines all allowed types of actions, which could be used within activity diagram to define signal
# processing
action_type_list = ["ADD", "SUB"]

# This list defines all types of actions, which require to distinguish in addition first input signal
action_type_req_first_input_signal_list = ["SUB"]
