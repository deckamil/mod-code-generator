# This parameter for production version of Mod Code Generator (MCG) Converter Component (CC)
# should be set to false, otherwise it allows to display additional information in console
# during run of Mod Code Generator (MCG) Converter Component (CC)
MCG_CC_TEST_RUN = True

# This parameter express length of model file names, i.e. names of .exml files, which are used
# to store and save model data; an example of model file name: b17d413f-fa9f-4e26-8e8c-9485d9c9ed3d.exml

# This parameter defines offset of signal name after "target" marker in merged node, i.e. number of
# characters after "target" marker occurrence, where beginning of signal name occurs, an example:
# eng_gain1 target eng_gain2 target ADD a084fca5-1c0a-4dfd-881b-21c3f83284e7 target eng_gain_total

# This parameter defines offset of signal name after "*FIRST*" marker in merged node or line of .exml file,
# i.e. number of characters after "*FIRST*" marker occurrence, where beginning of signal name occurs, an example:
# *FIRST* some_signal *FIRST*

# This parameter defines offset of action uid before last "target" marker in merged node, i.e. number of
# characters before last "target" marker occurrence, where beginning of action uid occurs, an example:

# This parameter defines offset, which is used to cut off first input signal node from merged node, i.e. first input
# signal, its two markers "*FIRST*" and "target" marker, please note that length of first input signal name must be
# added to the offset in order to calculate final offset used to cut desired part from merged node, an example of
# merged node with first input signal node and without it:
# eng_temp1 target *FIRST* eng_temp2 *FIRST* target SUB 4de5134b-40f6-44ae-a649-1cacb525963b target eng_temp_diff
# eng_temp1 target SUB 4de5134b-40f6-44ae-a649-1cacb525963b target eng_temp_diff

# This parameter defines start offset of name element after "name" marker in line of .exml file, i.e.
# number of characters after "name" marker occurrence, where beginning of name element occurs, an example:
# <ID name="ADD" mc="Standard.OpaqueAction" uid="4f855500-ccdd-43a6-87d3-cc06dd16a59b"/>

# This parameter defines start offset of uid element after "uid" marker in line of .exml file, i.e.

# This parameter defines end offset of uid element before end of .exml file line, i.e.

# Converter Component (CC), i.e. list of arguments:
#       - model path
