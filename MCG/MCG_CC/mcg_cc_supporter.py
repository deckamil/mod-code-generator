# Description:
# This class provides additional methods and parameters reused by other classes.
class Supporter(object):

    # This parameter defines offset of signal or structure name after "$TARGET$" marker in merged node,
    # i.e. number of characters after occurrence of "$TARGET$" marker, where beginning of signal or
    # structure name occurs, an example:
    # eng_gain1 $TARGET$ eng_gain2 $TARGET$ ADD a084fca5-1c0a-4dfd-881b-21c3f83284e7 $TARGET$ eng_gain_total
    TARGET_OFFSET = 9

    # This parameter defines offset of signal name after "$FIRST$" marker in merged node or line of .exml file,
    # i.e. number of characters after occurrence of "$FIRST$" marker, where beginning of signal name occurs, an example:
    # $FIRST$ some_signal
    FIRST_INPUT_SIGNAL_OFFSET = 8

    # This parameter defines offset of action or component uid before end of action or component definition,
    # i.e. number of characters before occurrence of action or component definition end, where beginning of action
    # or component uid occurs, plus one additional character to accommodate space between action type or component
    # name and uid, an example:
    # ADD fd5be3ed-0d38-42d0-ab56-d1058657eee8
    UID_OFFSET = -37
