# Description:
# This class provides additional methods and parameters reused by other classes.
class FileSupporter(object):

    # This parameter defines start offset of name element after "name" marker in line of .exml file, i.e.
    # number of characters after occurrence of "name" marker, where beginning of name element occurs, an example:
    # <ID name="ADD" mc="Standard.OpaqueAction" uid="4f855500-ccdd-43a6-87d3-cc06dd16a59b"/>
    NAME_START_OFFSET = 6

    # This parameter defines end offset of name element before "mc" marker in line of .exml file, i.e.
    # number of characters before occurrence of "mc" marker, where end of name element occurs, an example:
    # <ID name="ADD" mc="Standard.OpaqueAction" uid="4f855500-ccdd-43a6-87d3-cc06dd16a59b"/>
    NAME_END_OFFSET = -2

    # This parameter defines start offset of uid element after "uid" marker in line of .exml file, i.e.
    # number of characters after occurrence of "uid" marker, where beginning of uid element occurs, an example:
    # <ID name="ADD" mc="Standard.OpaqueAction" uid="4f855500-ccdd-43a6-87d3-cc06dd16a59b"/>
    UID_START_OFFSET = 5

    # This parameter defines end offset of uid element before end of .exml file line, i.e.
    # number of characters before occurrence of .exml file line end, where end of uid element occurs, an example:
    # <ID name="ADD" mc="Standard.OpaqueAction" uid="4f855500-ccdd-43a6-87d3-cc06dd16a59b"/>
    UID_END_OFFSET = -3

    # Description:
    # This method looks for <name> element within line of .exml file, an example of .exml file line:
    # <ID name="ADD" mc="Standard.OpaqueAction" uid="4f855500-ccdd-43a6-87d3-cc06dd16a59b"/>

        # get name
        name = line[name_position + FileSupporter.NAME_START_OFFSET:mc_position + FileSupporter.NAME_END_OFFSET]

        # return name
        return name

    # Description:
    # This method looks for <uid> element within line of .exml file, an example of .exml file line:
    # <ID name="ADD" mc="Standard.OpaqueAction" uid="4f855500-ccdd-43a6-87d3-cc06dd16a59b"/>
    @staticmethod

        # get uid
        uid = line[uid_position + FileSupporter.UID_START_OFFSET:len(line) + FileSupporter.UID_END_OFFSET]

        # return uid
        return uid
